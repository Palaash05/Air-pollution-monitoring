# Air-pollution-monitoring
This project is about collecting data using arduino and then off loading the data onto the raspeberry pi, which hosts a server made using node js.
this data is then stored in firebase and from there the web app can retrieve the pollution level of the entered coordinate. The web app also plots the coordinate on the map and the points
where the pollution level is greater than a certain value. I have used the mapmyindia api.
